###### Vatican Museums is my Favorite Museum

The Vatican Museums are the **public museums** of the Vatican City. They display works from the **immense collection** amassed by the **Catholic Church** and the papacy throughout the centuries, including several of the most renowned **Roman sculptures** and most important **masterpieces of Renaissance** art in the world.
